____
A collection of helpers for convenient use of GDB pretty printers with
accompanying build system modules.
____

WARNING: Not an official Boost tool yet!

The core of this project is a couple of utility Python scripts.

* <<embed-gdb-extension-py>> takes a Python GDB extension module (the most
  common such extesnsion is a set of pretty printers) and produces C code that
  pushes the contents of that module into a special binary section, so that
  GDB could automatically load those pretty printers during debugging.

* <<generate-gdb-test-runner-py>> takes C or C++ source files that have special
  comment lines and creates a Python program that sets breakpoints on those
  lines to check if printed expressions produce the desired output.


== Install

You can just clone or download the sources.

== Usage

For convenience of using the provided tools the project also provides a CMake
module and a b2 module. For direct usage consult the <<api-direct>> subsection
in the API section.

=== CMake

```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt
find_package(BoostPrettyPrinters)
if(BoostPrettyPrinters_FOUND)
    boost_pretty_printers_embed_gdb_extension(
        TARGET regenerate_printers
        INPUT gdb_printers.py
        OUTPUT include/myproject/gdb_printers.hpp
        EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)
endif()

# test/CMakeLists.txt
if(BoostPrettyPrinters_HAS_GDB)
    boost_pretty_printers_test_gdb_printers(
        TEST test_gdb_printers
        SOURCES printers.cpp
        EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)
    target_link_libraries(test_gdb_printers PRIVATE myproject)
endif()
```

Note: In order for `find_package` to find the provided CMake module you
need to append the installation directory of PrettyPrinters to
`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` variable. This is normally done either from the command
line or via presets. For example:

```sh
cmake -S.. -B. -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=path/to/pretty_printers
```

=== b2

```jam
# build.jam
using boost-pretty-printers ;

import boost-pretty-printers ;
boost-pretty-printers.gdb-python-header gdb_printers.hpp
    : gdb_printers.py
    : <location>include/mymproject
    ;
always gdb_printers.hpp ;
alias regenerate-printers : gdb_printers.hpp ;
explicit regenerate-printers gdb_printers.hpp ;

# test/build.jam
import boost-pretty-printers ;
boost-pretty-printers.test-gdb-printers gdb-printers
    : printers.cpp
      ..//myproject
    ;
explicit gdb-printers ;
```

== API

=== CMake module

```
find_package(BoostPrettyPrinters [QUIET])
```

==== Variables
This module will set the following variables in your project:.

BoostPrettyPrinters_FOUND:: True if both the module and a Python 3 Interpreter
    were found.

BoostPrettyPrinters_HAS_GDB:: True if GDB executable was found.

BoostPrettyPrinters_GDB:: The GDB executable to use.

==== Functions

===== boost_pretty_printers_embed_gdb_extension
```
boost_pretty_printers_embed_gdb_extension(
    TARGET target
    INPUT input
    OUTPUT output
    [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
    [FLAGS flags...])
```
Defines a custom target `target` that creates a C file `output` from a Python
script `input` by running <<embed-gdb-extension-py>>.

If `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL` is set the target will not be added to the default build
target.

`FLAGS` are addtional flags passed to <<embed-gdb-extension-py>>, e.g.
`--header-guard=` or `--disable-macro=`.

===== boost_pretty_printers_test_gdb_printers
```
boost_pretty_printers_test_gdb_printers(
    TEST test
    [PROGRAM program]
    SOURCES [srcs...]
    [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL])
```
. Defines a custom target that creates a Python program from `srcs` by
  running <<generate-gdb-test-runner-py>>.
. Defines executable target `program` with the provided `srcs`.
. Defines a test `test` that uses GDB as a Python interpreter for script from
  step 1 to debug the program from step 2.

If `PROGRAM` is not set then the executable target's name is assumed to be the
same as `test`.

If `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL` is set then both the executable target and the custom
target will not be added to the default build target.


=== b2 module

```
using boost-pretty-printers : [path/to/gdb] ;
```

==== Rules

===== has-gdb
```
rule has-gdb ( )
```
Returns a true value if GDB program was found.

===== embed-gdb-extension
```
rule embed-gdb-extension ( target : sources + : requirements * : usage-requirements * )
```
Main target rule that creates a C file from a Python script by running
<<embed-gdb-extension-py>>.

Usually, you would use `<location>` feature to create the file in the headers
directory. Use the `<flags>` feature to pass additional flags to
`embed-gdb-extension.py`, for example
`<flags>--header-guard=MYPROJECT_GDB_PRINTERS_HPP`.


===== test-gdb-printers
```
rule test-gdb-printers ( target : sources + : requirements * : default-build * : usage-requirements * )
```
Main target rule that

. creates a Python program sources by running <<generate-gdb-test-runner-py>>;
. compiles and links the sources into a program;
. runs GDB as a Python interpreter for script from step 1 to debug the program
  from step 2.

=== Direct usage

[#embed-gdb-extension-py]
==== embed-gdb-extension.py
```sh
embed-gdb-extension.py input [output] [--header-guard HEADER_GUARD] [--disable-macro DISABLE_MACRO]
```

Creates a C file that pushes contents of a GDB Python extension file
into .debug_gdb_scripts ELF section.

Positional arguments:

input:: Input file; must be written in Python.
output:: Output file; if not provided, the result is printed to standard
    output.

Options:

--header-guard:: Header guard macro to use; if not provided, the value is
  deduced from the output file name; to remove the header guard macro use empty
  value (`--header-guard=`).

--disable-macro:: Macro to disable pretty printer embedding; by default
  `BOOST_ALL_NO_EMBEDDED_GDB_SCRIPTS`; to remove the disable macro use empty
  value (`--disable-macro=`).


[#generate-gdb-test-runner-py]
==== generate-gdb-test-runner.py
```
generate-gdb-test-runner.py input [output]
```

Creates a Python script from C++ source files to control a GDB test of those
source files.

```cpp
int n = 1;
// TEST_EXPR( 'n', '1' )
```

The resulting script commands GDB to set a breakpoint on each line with a
special comment. Then the script will test that printing the expression in the
first argument of `TEST_EXPR` (e.g. `print n`) produces the output equal to the
second argument of `TEST_EXPR` (e.g. `1`). Note that the breakpoint is set
effectively on the next statement. Also note that multiline comments are not
supported.

In some cases you need to know some run-time values to know the expected
output. In that case you can provide extra arguments to `TEST_EXPR`. Those will
be in turn printed by GDB, and their output will be substituted into the second
argument of `TEST_EXPR` using Python's `str.format`:

```cpp
unsigned char buf[1024];
monotonic_resource mr(buf);
// TEST_EXPR( 'mr', 'monotonic_resource[buffer={0}]', '/a &buf' )
```

(The option `/a` tells `print` to output just the address, without type
information).


Positional arguments:

input:: Input files.
output:: Output file; if not provided, the result is printed to the standard
    output.
